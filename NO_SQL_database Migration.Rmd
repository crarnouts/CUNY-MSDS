##Load Tables
//Clear Existing nodes and relationship from database
match (a) optional match (a)-[r]-() delete a,r;

//LOAD airlines table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///airlines.csv" AS airlines
CREATE (al: Airline {car_id: airlines.carrier, car_name: airlines.name});

//LOAD airports table
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM "file:///airports.csv" AS airports

#RNeo4j Package
There was a working RNeo4j package so that R and and Neo4j could connect seemlessly but it appears this package has been taken down

#Pros and Cons of Graph Databases
##Pros

1.NOSQL queries often execute much faster than those used in relational models, particularly compared to SQL databases with 20+ table joins.

2.Data summaries and basic manipulations can often be achieved using significantly less code; so code readability is improved.

3.NOSQL environments are not restricted to the rigid schema definitions imposed by typical RDMS models.

##Cons

1.Most software developers are comfortable working with SQL-based databases; however, there are far fewer individuals accustomed to working in NOSQL environments. This can be a problem for employers with immediate business needs.

2.rigidity imposed by RDMS models is often seen as a positive for employers with transactional processes that require near-perfect accuracy. SQL-based systems are generally perceived as being superior to NOSQL models in this regard.
